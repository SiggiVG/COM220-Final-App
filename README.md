# COM220-Final-App
# A Blood Alcohol Content Tracker app

This was a the final class project for our Mobile App Developement course. The repository says that there were 11 contributors, but there was more like 13 or 14, as not all of them were using source control properly (much to our chagrin).

The developement cycle for this app was very quick, about two weeks, and it shows as important features are missing. The app is of May finished, and no more work is planned for it. 

TODO: Will update with app store status

Forked from https://github.com/rcaporino/COM220-Final-App who was in charge of source control for the project.

For this project, I (SiggiVG) handled GPS services and the Come Find Me feature, which at the push of a button sends a google maps link to anyone in your "Party", as well as interfacing between the persistant data storage module and application.

There is an issue where people cannot be removed from your party, as there is no remove feature to the persistant data storage module due to an oversight on planning.

To install/play with, merely clone locally and import it into android studio.
